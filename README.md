This file generates a plot of the Mandelbrot set. It creates a 2D grid of complex numbers, applies the iterative process of the Mandelbrot function, and stores the iteration counts. Finally, it plots the Mandelbrot set using matplotlib.

To run the program and visualize the Mandelbrot set, execute the following command:

python mandelbrot_plotter.py
